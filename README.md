# ABM-for-irrigation-efficiency-paradox
An agent-based model to simulate farmers' water-land use dynamics in response to both technical irrigation efficiency improvements and economic policy adjustments.
This repository contains the code for the research paper "Modeling Irrigation Efficiency Paradox from Farmersâ€™ Behaviors". If you use this code in your research, please cite the corresponding paper

## File Structure

### Main Simulation File
- `Sim55Agent.py`: The main file for running the simulation.

### Core Components
- `Agent.py`: Defines the farmer class and specifies agent behaviors.
- `plot_utils.py`: Contains all the plotting functions used in the project.

### Policy Simulations
- `SimAgentPolicy.py`: Simulates different policy scenarios.

### Analysis Tools
- `Sensitivity_analysis.py`: Performs sensitivity analysis for the model.

## Usage
To run the simulation, execute the main file:
```bash
python Sim55Agent.py
