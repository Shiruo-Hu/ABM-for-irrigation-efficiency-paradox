# ABM-for-irrigation-efficiency-paradox
An agent-based model to simulate farmers' water-land use dynamics in response to both technical irrigation efficiency improvements and economic policy adjustments.
This repository contains the code for the research paper "Modeling Irrigation Efficiency Paradox from Farmersâ€™ Behaviors". 
If you use this code in your research, please cite the corresponding paper.

## File Structure

### Main Simulation File
- `Sim55Agent.py`: The main file for running the simulation.

### Core Components
- `Agent.py`: Defines the farmer class and specifies agent behaviors.
- `plot_utils.py`: Contains all the plotting functions used in the project.

### Policy Simulations
- `SimAgentPolicyPw.py`: Water price - irrigation efficiency combination scenarios.
- `SimAgentPolicyPc.py`: Crop price - irrigation efficiency combination scenarios.
- `SimAgentPolicyAlpha.py`: Land cost - irrigation efficiency combination scenarios.

### Analysis Tools
- `Sensitivity_analysis.py`: Performs sensitivity analysis for the model.

### Input files
- `sub_crop_params.xlsx`: The input file used for initializing agent parameters.

## Usage
To run the simulation, execute the main file:
```bash
python Sim55Agent.py
